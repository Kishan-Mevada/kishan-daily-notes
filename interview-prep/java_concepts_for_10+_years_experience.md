# Java Concepts for 10+ Years Experience – Master Guide

---

## 1. Core Java (Advanced)

- Memory Management, GC (G1, ZGC, CMS), Escape Analysis
- Multithreading (ExecutorService, ForkJoinPool, Future, CompletableFuture)
- Concurrency Tools: ReentrantLock, Semaphore, CyclicBarrier
- Java Memory Model, Happens-Before, Deadlocks, Race Conditions
- Java 8–21 Features:
    - Streams, Lambdas, Optional
    - Records, Sealed Classes, Virtual Threads
- Deep knowledge of Collections and their internal implementations

---

## 2. JVM & Performance Tuning

- JVM Architecture: Classloaders, JIT, GC, Bytecode Execution
- Tools: JFR, VisualVM, YourKit, GC Logs
- Tuning: `-Xmx`, `-Xms`, GC tuning, profiling live apps
- Performance bottlenecks, flame graphs, thread dumps analysis

---

## 3. Spring Framework & Ecosystem

- Core Concepts: IoC, AOP, Bean Lifecycle
- Spring Boot: Starters, Autoconfiguration, Profiles, Actuators
- Spring Data JPA:
    - Entity relationships
    - Query optimization
    - Caching (first-level/second-level)
- Spring MVC:
    - Controllers, Filters, Exception Handling
- Spring Security:
    - JWT, OAuth2, CSRF, CORS

---

## 4. Microservices Architecture

- Principles: Bounded Contexts, Resiliency, Scalability
- Tools: Eureka, Feign, Resilience4j, API Gateway
- Communication:
    - REST vs gRPC
    - Kafka for async messaging
- Deployment:
    - Docker + Kubernetes
- Observability:
    - Logs, Metrics (Micrometer, Prometheus), Tracing (Zipkin)

---

## 5. System Design

- Real-World Design Scenarios:
    - Rate Limiter
    - Notification System
    - File Storage System
- Key Concepts:
    - Load Balancing, Caching (Redis, CDN)
    - Sharding, Eventual Consistency, CAP Theorem
- Design Patterns:
    - Singleton, Factory, Strategy, Observer, Command
- DDD, Modular Monolith, Hexagonal Architecture

---

## 6. Interview Question Bank

### Core Java:
- Explain internal working of HashMap
- How does Java Memory Model handle concurrency?
- Differences between `synchronized`, `volatile`, and `Lock`

### Spring Boot:
- What is Spring Boot auto-configuration?
- How to write a custom starter?
- Difference between `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`

### Microservices:
- Saga vs Choreography Pattern
- Circuit Breaker design and tools
- Securing microservices using OAuth2

### System Design:
- Design YouTube
- Design a distributed log aggregator
- Build scalable URL shortener
